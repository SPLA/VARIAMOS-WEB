  "about_team_raul_desc": "Since 2012, Raúl Mazo has been an Associate Professor (HDR) with the Panthéon Sorbonne University and researcher with the CRI (Centre de Recherche en Informatique) and GIDITIC (Grupo de Investigación: Desarrollo e Innovación en Tecnologías de la Información y las Comunicaciones).  His research and teaching topics are around the application of artificial intelligence techniques, optimization (by exact and approximate methods), software engineering and control to improve the design, simulation and implementation of cyber-physical, self-adaptive and software-intensive systems.  The research program developed by Raúl Mazo is fruitful and promising. It has attained great confidence and credibility (which explains the trust of important French, Mediterranean, Latin-American and European programs, such as ANR, PHC UTIQUE, Colciencias, H2020 and ITEA, to finance his works). His research results constitute a collection of more than 80 scientific contributions characterised by its innovative attractiveness, the rigor of the solutions, the performance of the software developed to support the proposed approaches and the broadness of his research activities. Raúl Mazo’s awards and honors include the Order of merit of Carolina del Principe as Distinguished Citizen (summer 2008), the 70 years of the Engineering Faculty award, for outstanding graduate of the Computer and Systems Engineering Program of the University of Antioquia (summer 2013), and the Best Paper awards of the IEEE International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS 2011, RCIS 2018), the 35rd International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC 2011) and the International conference on Complex Systems Design & Management (CSD&M 2013).",
